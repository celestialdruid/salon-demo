# Locs & Looks (Hair Stylist Demo)

## Project Objectives
To design the front end of a website for a small business hair salon in order to demonstrate my ability to:

- Design a website that reflects a business' identity, what sets them apart, and the value of their services

- Design, create, test and maintain web sites and content that are visually pleasing and content rich, with user-friendly interfaces and intuitive navigation that will enrich/optimize the exchange of information and produce effective communications for a customer

- Clearly display available services in a visually pleasing and dynamic manner
